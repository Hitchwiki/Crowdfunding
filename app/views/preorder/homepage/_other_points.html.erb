    <p id="section-0">We've set our goals so that we have enough time to get at least combined map working. If we have money left, we will organize more hackathons later and work also on other Hitchwiki related projects. More donations will simply allow us to do more.</p>
    <ul>
      <li id="section-1">
        <h4>Goal 1</h4>
        <p>Combine map and wiki into one view including markers, descriptions, comments and ratings.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="section-2">
        <h4>Goal 2</h4>
        <p>Ensure everything works well on mobile devices. Make it simple to edit and contribute. Add an easy way to switch between languages.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="section-3">
        <h4>Goal 3</h4>
        <p>Implement same map features to <a href="http://nomadwiki.org">Nomadwiki</a> and <a href="http://trashwiki.org">Trashwiki</a>. Imagine wild camping places and dumpsterdiving spots marked on a map.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="section-4">
        <h4>Goal 4</h4>
        <p>Work on a new project aiming to allow hitchhikers find & host each other on the road. We want to add possiblity to register there with Hitchwiki accounts. <a href="http://ideas.trustroots.org">Read more.</a></p>
